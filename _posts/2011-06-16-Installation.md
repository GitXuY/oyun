Oyun is available for almost any platform you can think of.  Read on to see how to install it on your system.

Installation on Windows
=======================

Oyun is distributed as a standard Windows installer.  Double-click it
to install, and then start Oyun from the shortcuts created in your
Start Menu.

Installation on Mac OS X
========================

The installation of Oyun on OS X will be similar to most every
application you've installed on Mac OS X.  Download the OS X binary,
which is a "disk image" in .DMG format.  Open it, and you will find
the Oyun application.  Drag the application file to your
"Applications" folder, and run it as usual.

Installation on Linux
=====================

At the moment, we do not offer any binary packages for Oyun on Linux.
However, Linux installation can always be performed by compiling from
source.  For information about this, please consult the technical
documentation available on the [Oyun
developer wiki](http://github.com/cpence/oyun/wiki/).  In short, a simple
`cmake`, `make`, `sudo make install` should work.  If you want to run
the binary in a location other than the prefix under which it was
compiled, you will need to set the environment variable `DOCDIR` to
the location of the documentation file `oyun.htb`.
