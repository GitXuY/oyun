Welcome to the website for Logos, a simulator designed to allow users to run tournaments in which various strategies (coded in C++ or as finite state machines) compete at 2x2 games like the Prisoner's Dilemma. Competitions can either be one-off round-robin tournaments, or an evolutionary tournament in which fraction of population is proportional to score in the last round of the tournament.
