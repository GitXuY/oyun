Logos is a simulator designed to allow various strategies to compete at playing the Prisoner's Dilemma (for more information about the theory of Logos, see [[Game Theory and Evolution]]).

Logos allows you to write strategies, either in C++ (as Logos is [[Open Source software|http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php]]), or as Finite State Machines, a restricted programming language that allows you to write powerful strategies without knowing all that much about computer programming.

Logos will then run tournaments between these strategies (in the style of Robert Axelrod's seminal [[Evolution of Cooperation|http://amzn.com/0465005640]]), both one-time round-robin tournaments where individual strategies compete for the highest score, as well as "evolutionary" tournaments where score reflects "fitness" in a population of individuals.
