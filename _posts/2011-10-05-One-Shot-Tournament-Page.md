On this page, you can run a One-Shot Tournament, which consists of a
single run in which each player plays against each other player in a
round-robin tournament.  The "winner" of the tournament is the player
with the highest score.

Tournament Players List
=======================

On the left-hand side of the screen is a list of all the players that
have been added to the tournament.  To add more players, press the
"Back" button to return to the player selection screen.  The name of
each player is listed, and after the tournament has been run, each
player's overall score will be shown.

Tournament Maches List
======================

In the center of the right-hand side of the screen is a list of all
the matches that will be played in this tournament.  Each match
consists of five games, and there is one match played for each pair of
players in the players list.  After the tournament is played, the
victor of each match as well as the score registered by players one
and two (the first and second players listed under "Competitors") will
be listed.

To run the tournament, click the "Run Tournament" button above the
tournament matches list.  After the tournament is run, the winner will
be displayed beneath the maches list.  If you would like to see the
detailed list of moves played during a given match, click on a given
match and press "Show Details...."  A window will be displayed showing
each move in each game.  You don't need to record this detailed match
information if you'd like to keep it; an opportunity will be given to
save this data on the next screen.
