  <p>Welcome to the website for Logos, a simulator designed to allow users to run 
  tournaments in which various strategies (coded in C++ or as finite state machines) 
  compete at 2x2 games like the Prisoner's Dilemma. Competitions can either be one-off 
  round-robin tournaments, or an evolutionary tournament in which fraction of population 
  is proportional to score in the last round of the tournament.</p>

  <p>The current version of Logos is v2.0 Beta 2, released on October 21, 2010.</p>
