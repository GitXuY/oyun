README for Logos
----------------

Logos is a program you can use to run tournaments between various strategies
playing normal-form games such as the prisoner's dilemma.  The classic work on
such tournaments is Robert Axelrod's *The Evolution of Cooperation,* and Logos
takes much inspiration from such tournaments.

Logos allows you to create players, using a simple finite state machine syntax,
and these players then compete in tournaments -- either one-off, round-robin
tournaments or "evolutionary" tournaments in which strategies compete to
increase their proportion in a "population" over a number of generations.


Installation
------------

In general, if you have an appropriate version of wxWidgets and a normal set of
userspace tools (such as on Linux, OS X, or MinGW), you should just be able to
execute the usual `configure', `make', `make install' combo.
