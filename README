README for Logos

See the Logos website: http://cpence.github.com/logos/

Logos is a program you can use to run tournaments between various strategies
playing normal-form games such as the prisoner's dilemma.  The classic work on
such tournaments is Robert Axelrod's *The Evolution of Cooperation,* and Logos
takes much inspiration from such tournaments.

Logos allows you to create players, using a simple finite state machine syntax,
and these players then compete in tournaments -- either one-off, round-robin
tournaments or "evolutionary" tournaments in which strategies compete to
increase their proportion in a "population" over a number of generations.


Installation
------------

In general, if you have an appropriate version of wxWidgets and a normal set of
userspace tools (such as on Linux, OS X, or MinGW), you should just be able to
execute the usual `configure', `make', `make install' combo.

In detail, the compilation of Logos requires:

* wxWidgets (preferably version 2.9, and preferably statically-linked)
* Doxygen (for the compilation of the source-code docs)
* pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/, for compilation of the manual)
* pdflatex (http://tug.org/texlive/, for compilation of the manual)
* zip (http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html, for compilation of the manual)
